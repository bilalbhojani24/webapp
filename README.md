### React Static Web App

This is my first multi-page static web app made using React and React-Router.

### Content used and learnt 

1. Used react-router to route from one page to another which is main feature of single-page-application (SPA).
2. Made fake API within application as Sdata.jsx file and imported it in card.jsx in service page and rendered it using advance array method i.e. map().
3. Used Bootstrap 5 [alpha version] for making UI.
